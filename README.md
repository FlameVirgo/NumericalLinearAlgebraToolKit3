A lightweight, educational Numerical Linear Algebra toolkit in Java that implements core matrix and vector operations commonly encountered in linear algebra, numerical analysis, and applied mathematics. The library includes foundational algorithms such as determinant computation (via both recursive Laplace expansion and efficient LU decomposition with partial pivoting), matrix rank and nullity calculation, QR decomposition using Modified Gram–Schmidt, and object-oriented modeling of linear transformations with injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity checks. In addition, the toolkit provides a dense vector abstraction supporting operations like dot products, norms, vector arithmetic, and orthogonal projections. The project emphasizes algorithmic transparency, mathematical correctness, and defensive programming, avoiding external numerical libraries in favor of explicit implementations that are easy to inspect, extend, and learn from. While primarily designed for educational and academic use, the codebase is structured and documented to be clean, modular, and suitable for portfolio presentation or further research-oriented development.
